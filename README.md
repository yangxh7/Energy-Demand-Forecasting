# Energy Demand Forecasting Based on Weather Data

The python code presents an analysis of the relationship between weather information and daily energy usage/energy pricing in Melbourne, Australia. The code aims to provide insights into the factors that influence energy usage and pricing, inform readers around energy demand and its impacts from weather conditions.
